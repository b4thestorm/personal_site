I am a Jr. Rails developer by way of Sprinkle Labs. Where I spend the bulk of my day working on Product architecture for internal products, which are intended for potential commercial use. As a developer my day to day process consists of rapidly learning new technologies or solutions, and implementing them just as fast to merge feature branches and be happy. Technologies I use daily that I know use and love as a developer are: Git (source code versioning tool) Ruby (because its rails) HTML & CSS (everything on the web is HTML) Javascript (when the client side needs more love) Rspec (because minutest is Ok) Beyond this summary I am a person who focuses greatly on character building and being a team player. When things need to get done, they need to get done.""","CUNY Medgar Evers College Bachelors of Science, Biology/Biological Sciences , General 2007 Ð 2013 Activities and Societies: SIFE ( Students in Free Enterprise) , MEC Science , LSAMP (research club)","""Full Stack web,  Ruby on Rails, Ruby,  HTML CSS, Javascript"""
